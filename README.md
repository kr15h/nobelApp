# Nobel Laureates App

Data-driven projection mapping app for displaying Nobel laureates. One can configure the laureates in `bin/data/laureates.txt`. It uses an unicode font and thus can display all the special characters there are in the laureate names.

Use it at your own risk. Consult the `addons.make` file for dependencies. See the [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md) file if not sure what are the limits of using this code.
